# Java Quiz Application

A console-based interactive quiz application built in Java that tests knowledge of Java programming concepts. The application features multiple-choice questions with immediate feedback, explanations, and performance tracking.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz Interface**: User-friendly console-based interface with clear question presentation
- **Multiple Choice Questions**: 4-option questions covering various Java programming topics
- **Input Validation**: Robust input handling with error checking and user-friendly prompts
- **Immediate Feedback**: Shows correct/incorrect status after each question
- **Detailed Explanations**: Provides explanations for each answer to enhance learning
- **Performance Tracking**: Displays final score, correct/incorrect counts, and time taken
- **Question Randomization**: Questions are shuffled for variety in each quiz attempt
- **Replay Option**: Users can retake the quiz multiple times
- **Timer Functionality**: Tracks and displays total time taken to complete the quiz

## How to Run

1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   javac QuizApp.java
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   java QuizApp
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Read each question carefully
   - Enter your answer (A, B, C, or D)
   - Review the explanation after each question
   - View your final results
   - Choose whether to retry the quiz

## Sample Questions

The quiz currently includes questions on:
- Java inheritance (`extends` keyword)
- Data types and sizes (`int` size)
- Program entry points (`main()` method)
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Java Collections Framework

## What We Learned in This Project

### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Class Design**: Created a `Question` class to encapsulate question data and behavior
- **Encapsulation**: Used private fields with public methods to control access
- **Data Hiding**: Implemented proper getter methods while keeping internal data secure
- **Method Design**: Separated concerns by creating focused methods for specific tasks

### 2. **Java Collections Framework**
- **ArrayList Usage**: Utilized `List<Question>` to store and manage quiz questions
- **Collections Utility**: Used `Collections.shuffle()` to randomize question order
- **Dynamic Data Structures**: Worked with resizable arrays for flexible question management

### 3. **Input/Output Operations**
- **Scanner Class**: Implemented user input handling with `Scanner`
- **Console Output**: Used `System.out.println()` for formatted output
- **Input Validation**: Created robust input checking with try-catch blocks

### 4. **Exception Handling**
- **InputMismatchException**: Handled invalid user input gracefully
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Implemented proper error handling for user input
- **Custom Error Messages**: Provided meaningful feedback for invalid inputs
- **Exception Propagation**: Used nested exception handling for different error types

### 5. **Control Flow Structures**
- **For-Each Loops**: Iterated through questions and options efficiently
- **While Loops**: Implemented input validation and quiz retry functionality
- **Conditional Statements**: Used if-else for answer checking and flow control
- **Loop Control**: Managed program flow with break statements

### 6. **String Manipulation**
- **String Methods**: Used `trim()`, `toUpperCase()`, and `charAt()` for input processing
- **Character Operations**: Worked with `Character.toUpperCase()` for case-insensitive comparison
- **String Concatenation**: Built formatted output strings for user display

### 7. **Method Design and Modularity**
- **Method Separation**: Broke down functionality into focused, reusable methods
- **Static Methods**: Used static methods for utility functions
- **Parameter Passing**: Passed data between methods effectively
- **Return Values**: Designed methods to return appropriate data types

### 8. **Time Measurement**
- **System.currentTimeMillis()**: Measured quiz completion time
- **Performance Tracking**: Calculated and displayed elapsed time
- **Long Data Type**: Worked with time values using appropriate data types

### 9. **User Experience Design**
- **Clear Prompts**: Designed intuitive user interface messages
- **Feedback Systems**: Provided immediate response to user actions
- **Progress Indicators**: Showed question numbers and progress
- **Error Recovery**: Allowed users to correct invalid inputs

### 10. **Code Organization and Best Practices**
- **Naming Conventions**: Used descriptive variable and method names
- **Code Comments**: Added explanatory comments for complex logic
- **Consistent Formatting**: Maintained readable code structure
- **Resource Management**: Properly closed Scanner resources

### 11. **Data Validation and Security**
- **Input Sanitization**: Cleaned and validated user input
- **Boundary Checking**: Ensured input falls within expected ranges
- **Type Safety**: Used appropriate data types for different values
- **Error Prevention**: Anticipated and handled potential runtime errors

### 12. **Program Flow Control**
- **State Management**: Tracked quiz state (score, current question, etc.)
- **Loop Management**: Controlled program execution flow
- **Conditional Logic**: Implemented decision-making logic
- **Program Termination**: Handled graceful program exit

## Learning Outcomes
